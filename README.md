<b>Introduction</b>

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Task is to build an ETL Pipeline that extracts their data from S3, staging it in Redshift and then transforming data into a set of Dimensional and Fact Tables for their Analytics Team to continue finding Insights to what songs their users are listening to.

<b>Project Description</b>

Application of Data warehouse and AWS to build an ETL Pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift Will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL Statements that create fact and dimension tables from these staging tables to create analytics

<b>Project Datasets</b>

Song Data Path     -->     s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log Data Path      -->     s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log Data JSON Path -->     s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

<b>Song Dataset</b>

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example:

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

<b>Log Dataset</b>

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format. The log files in the dataset with are partitioned by year and month.
For example:

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what a single log file, 2018-11-13-events.json, looks like.

{"artist":"Pavement", "auth":"Logged In", "firstName":"Sylvie", "gender", "F", "itemInSession":0, "lastName":"Cruz", "length":99.16036, "level":"free", "location":"Klamath Falls, OR", "method":"PUT", "page":"NextSong", "registration":"1.541078e+12", "sessionId":345, "song":"Mercy:The Laundromat", "status":200, "ts":1541990258796, "userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0(Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4...)", "userId":10}

<b>Schema for Song Play Analysis</b>

A Star Schema would be required for optimized queries on song play queries

<b>Fact Table</b>

<b>songplays</b> - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

<b>Dimension Tables</b>

<b>users</b> - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

<b>songs</b> - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

<b>artists</b> - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

<b>time</b> - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

<b>Final Instructions</b>

1. Import all the necessary libraries
2. Create an IAM User Role, Assign appropriate permissions and create the Redshift Cluster make sure it's in the same region as the S3 "us-west-2"
3. Get the Value of Endpoint and Role for put into main configuration file
4. Authorize Security Access Group to Default TCP/IP Address
5. Launch database connectivity configuration
6. Create an IAM user, enable a programmatically access and assign an admin authorization, then put into main configuration file
7. Write the SQL queries in the 'sql_queries.py' file 
8. Go to Terminal write the command "python create_tables.py" and then "etl.py"
9. Should take around 4-10 minutes in total
10. Then you go back to jupyter notebook to test everything is working fine
11.  Now can delete the cluster, roles and assigned permission#
